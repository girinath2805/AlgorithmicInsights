## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of various algorithms and computational techniques implemented in Python. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented examples that can be used for educational purposes, research, or as a starting point for more complex projects.

## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the steepest descent direction. This section includes implementations of both one-dimensional and two-dimensional gradient descent, along with visualizations to illustrate the optimization process.

## Simulated Annealing

Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. In this repository, it is applied to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is a classic optimization problem that aims to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. The implementation demonstrates how simulated annealing can effectively find a near-optimal solution for TSP.

## Delay-and-Sum Beamforming

Delay-and-Sum Beamforming is a signal processing technique used in array signal processing. It combines signals received at various sensors to enhance the signal from a particular direction. This section includes an implementation of the delay-and-sum algorithm to reconstruct signals received at multiple microphones, along with visualizations of the reconstructed image.

## Prediction Analysis

This section contains a script for performing linear regression on admission prediction data. It includes steps to read data from a CSV file, perform linear regression to obtain coefficients, calculate predicted values, and evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Performance Comparison of Matrix Multiplication and Optimizing using Cython

This section includes a comparison of different methods for performing matrix multiplication: a custom implementation, the `@` operator, and `np.matmul`. The performance of each method is measured in terms of execution time and FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second). The results are visualized using log-log plots.

## Usage

Each section of the repository is contained within its own script or notebook. You can run these scripts individually to see the implementations and visualizations.
